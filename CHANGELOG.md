# Changelog

Notable changes to the Games hub. Newest first, in the shape
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) sets out.

Started 2026-08-11, so it does not reach back to the first fourteen games —
`ROADMAP.md` and the git log carry that history.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Klondike, Spider, FreeCell and Pyramid save and resume** (GHUB-0008)
  Close a game of patience part way through and it is waiting where you
  left it next time you open it. A shared card codec does all four, and
  checks the cards coming back really are the pack that was dealt before
  it puts them on the table.

- Chess remembers a game in progress — the board, whose move it is, the moves
  behind it and the strength all come back when you reopen it (GHUB-0006).
